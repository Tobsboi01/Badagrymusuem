      <p>BADAGRY: OF FIRSTS, SLAVE TRADE AND FREEDOM</p>

  <h1>Badagry is a town in Lagos, Nigeria, which shares a border with Benin Republic and served as a port for slave trade during the 16th – 18th century.
    ‎
    ‎I had driven past the town a number of times on visits to Cotonou years ago, and one of the things that fascinated me about it was the beautiful line up of coconut trees on the drive to the border. In exploring Badagry, I suddenly couldn’t think of coconuts, as the horrific stories frozen in time at the museums and the point of no return had me weak to my knees.
    ‎
    ‎Bedsides slavery, Badagry is also home to many “firsts” in Nigeria. I’ll be highlighting places of interest in Badagry and my experience there in a two part series so the post doesn’t become an epistle. Let’s get started on the first part, shall we?

    <h1>THE MUSEUMS OF BADAGRY

      ‎1. Badagry Heritage Museum.

      <h1>The building which houses the Badagry Heritage Museum was built in 1863 as an administrative building. It is said to be the first administrative building in Nigeria. I was so sad when I stepped out of the building, I didn’t remember to take a picture of it.

        ‎The museum houses artwork, relics and replicas of items from the slave trade.
